# Final_GeoQuiz_Extension
My Final App Extension adds a results page to GeoQuiz as well as incorporates some of my own design elements. Once the user opens GeoQuiz,
they will have to answer all six questions before the Results button is enabled. I used color schemes to make the buttons' purposes clearer, as well as increased the size and layout of the
textviews to improve legibility. Using intents similar to those of CheatActivity.java, the MainActivity starts
ResultActivity.java and passes a Score double. The user can then give inputs that alter the textviews based on the data they would like to see. The double score value is used 
calculate each result, which is then converted to a String. In this app the five elements I employed were Buttons (enabling/disabling based on user progress/taking inputs and changing layouts accordingly), 
TextViews with variable content and layouts), Intents to start ResultActivity.java, getEXTRA methods to pass data between activities, XML Layout design settings to make the layout intuitive in both portait 
and landscape mode.
